This tests whether a parent loading a local file can connect and communicate appropriately. If you open `parent.html` from your file system (not using a web server), you should see the following displayed in your browser:

```
3 X 2 = 6
```

If so, the connection and communication succeeded.

If you change the source code, you'll need to rebuild (`npm run build`) before testing again to see the changes.
